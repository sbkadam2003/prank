            What Happened To This Computer?
            All your personal data, photos, videos, work files, including your operating system have been encrypted and can be accessed again if you pay a ransome. 
            You can't access anything on this machine but this screen.
            <hr>
            </p>

            <p >
            You have one hour to pay the prize, otherwise you will no longer be able to decrypt them. Powering off or restarting your computer will also destroy your files.
            <hr>

            What Can You Do?
            You might be looking for a way to recover your files but don't waste your time. We use an unbreakable encryption so nobody can restore your files without a  decryption key.
            <hr>
            </p>

            <p >You can purchase your key using one of the payment methods listed below. You will get a code to paste in the input field and click Decrypt. After this you should be restored in a couple of minutes.

This procedure is absolutely legal, we are a certified and awarded company specialized in computer viruses and digital identity theft. We will send you an invoice for your payment.
